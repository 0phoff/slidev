## Motivation

I am making this because I found myself spending too much on layouting and styling slides when using apps like PowerPoint / Keynote / Google Slides. When sharing code snippets, I would also need to use other tools to generate the highlighted code as images over and over again. Which are just not ideal to me.

So as a frontend developer, why not solve it the way that fits better with what I am good that?

## Status

Status: **Alpha**

~~Currently, I will focus more on the content of the slides I need myself. I will update the slides of my next talk with it (you can also have a preview of it :P). **Think it as a template for making slides at this moment**. After finishing my talk, I will make this a standalone tool like VitePress where all you need is a command with a markdown file.~~

Alright, I broke my words again. It's now available as a standalone tool 🎉

**Docs and guides on [slidev.antfu.me](https://slidev.antfu.me)**

The best way to understand it is to try it, one command away:

```bash
npm init slidev
```

For a full example, you can check the [demo](./demo) folder, which is a draft for my next talk 😉.
